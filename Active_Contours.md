# Active Contours

## Introduction
Active Contours (Snakes) are energy minimising splines that deform to fit features. Snakes lock on to nearby minima in the potential energy generated by processing an image. This energy is minimied by using an iterative gradient descent process which depends on forces derived using variational calculus and Euler Lagrange Theory. In addition, _internal_ (smoothing) forces produce tension and stiffness that constrain the behaviour of the models and _external_ forces may be specified by a supervising process or human user. For example, Gaussian smoothing followed by convolution with a gradiaent-squared operator generates a potential in which extreme correspond to edges in the original image. Over a series of iterations the force generated by this energy drives the snake into alignment with the nearest salient edge, as shown in the figure below. However, the snake must also satisfy some internal constraints – for example, it must be smooth and continuous in outline. Sometimes the user imposes additional external constraints such as attraction or repulsion.

Active Snakes do not try to solve the entire problem of finding salient image contours. They rely on other mechanisms to place them somewhere near the desired contour. However, even in cases where no satisfactory automatic starting mechanism exists, snakes can still be used for semiautomatic image interpretation. If an expert user pushes a snake close to an intended contour, its energy minimization will carry it the rest of the way. The minimization provides a ‘power assist’ for a person pointing to a contour feature.

Many motion tracking systems utilize active snakes to model moving objects. The main limitations of the models are
1. that they usually only incorporate edge information (ignoringother image characteristics) possibly combined with some prior expectation of shape.
2. that they must be initialised close to the feature of interest if they are to avoid being trapped by other local minima.

## Snake Energy Functionals
A snake is a parametric contour that deforms over a series of iteratinos. Each element **x**(_s,t_) along the contour therefore depends on two parameters:

s = space(curve) parameter

t = time (iteration) parameter

The contour is influenced by internal and external constraints and by image forces as outlined below:

1. **Internal Forces**: Internal constraints give the model tension and stiffness.
2. **External Forces**: External constraints come from high level sources such as human operators or automatic initialization procedures.
3. **Image Forces** Image energy is used to drive the model towards salient features such as light and dark regions, edges and terminations.

The snake can be parametrically represented as
