### Active Contours

Active Contours (Snakes) are energy minimising curves that deform to fit features. Snakes lock on to nearby minima in the potential energy generated by processing an image. This energy is minimied by using an iterative gradient descent process which depends on forces derived using variational calculus and Euler Lagrange Theory.
Many motion tracking systems utilize active snakes to model moving objects. Active Contours (snakes) are energy minimizing contours that deform to fit image features
